# Accounts

We have covered series, collections and charts.

The last concept is 'account'. All collections are created inside an account.

## User or Publisher account

When you create an account on Statit, we ask you whether you want a 'User' or 'Publisher' account.

'User' accounts allow you to access public series and the private collections you are invited to. The interface is limited to this. These accounts can not be accessed by other users.

'Publisher' account allow you to publish series and share them with  others (team, organisation, community). The interface is slightly more complex.


## Private accounts

**Private** accounts are only accessible to authorised members and are not visible publicly on the Internet.



## Public accounts

**Public accounts** are visible on the Internet. You can browse some public accounts [here](https://www.gostatit.com/public).

Inside a public account, it is possible to create private collections accessible only to certain members. These will only be visible by authorised collaborators.


## Next steps

We have now explained the main concepts of Statit: series, collections and accounts.

In the [next section](/favs), we will show you how to save favorites, alerts and personal dashboards.
