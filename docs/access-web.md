# Accessing series on the web

This page explains how to explore and use time series on the web.


## Time series

Let's have a look at [Monthly air temperature in Britanny in France](https://www.gostatit.com/climat-fr/cei-m/region/bretagne/temp) since 1980.

As you click on the link, you will reach a time serie. It is described by its name, description, unit and finally the serie presented as a chart.


## Understanding trends

Some of the series are hard to understand as such. This is the case for volatile measures that are highly seasonal like temperature.

To that end, on the serie page, you can click on the small wheel on the right hand side. A menu will appear with different ways to look at the serie: changing the
frequency (from monthly to yearly serie) or to average the data over last periods.

In the example above, in Aggregation, select annual (and average). In Transformation, select last 4 periods. The underlying trend
  of roughly 1.5 degrees Celsius increase in the last 30 years will be easier to spot then.


## Downloading the serie

You might now need to work with this data to compare it with other long-term trends, transform it or present it in a chart.

Click on the down arrow on the right hand side and select the format you are interested in. The difference between the European and
the UK & US formats lie in the decimal separator (, for Europe and . for UK & US)


## Following the serie

If you are interested in the serie and would like to save it for future reference, click on the star on the top right of the screen. You will need to be signed-in to access that feature.

The series you follow will be accessible from your home page in the favorites tab. On this tab, you will be able to set a notification when
to get an email when the serie is updated or on a weekly or monthly basis.


## Collections

Time series belong to collections which are groups of series that are related to each other. You can navigate in the collection by clicking on the grey links just under the serie name.

Here is the link to the collection of [long-term monthly air temperatures](https://www.gostatit.com/climat-fr/cei-m) that includes the serie we have looked at before.

The collection page will provide the background on the time series published: rationale, sources, methodology, organisation ...


## Next steps

You have now learnt the basics of Statit: how to find a serie, how to use it and follow it, how to find a collection and navigate inside it.
