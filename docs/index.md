# Welcome

Hi, welcome on the **user guide**.

Statit is a platform to share time series. This guide will explain some basics about the platform and how to access series.

If you are familiar with all this and are looking to publish series, the guide is [here](http://helppub_en.gostatit.com)

The guide is organised in **three parts**:

* [**Getting started**](gs/index.md) - understand how Statit works and access series
* [**Following series**](favs/index.md) - create an account, save favourite series, create alerts
* [**Use Excel**](excel/index.md) - access series directly in Excel

**Good luck**. Do not hesitate to [**get in touch**](mailto:hi@gostatit.com)  with any question.

Best ✌️
