# Welcome

Hi, welcome on **Statit user guide**.

Statit is an online library to let teams and communities share metrics easily. **This guide will explain the basics about the tool**. It is organised in **three sections**:

* [**Getting started**](gs/index.md) - understanding how Statit works and access metrics
* [**Following series**](perso/index.md) - saving your favorite metrics, creating alerts
* [**Using Excel**](excel/index.md) - accessing metrics directly in Excel

If you are already familiar with all this and are looking to understand how to publish your own series, please visit the [publisher guide](http://helppub_en.gostatit.com)

**Good luck**. Do not hesitate to [**get in touch**](mailto:help@gostatit.com) with any question.

Best ✌️
