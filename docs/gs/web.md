# **Get started on the Web**

Statit can be used fully in the browser.

This section explains **how to start using Statit with a web browser**. For the documentation regarding creating workspace and publishing metrics, please head over to the [**web reference**](/reference/web.md).

Before continuing, **please sign-in to your account or create one [here](https://gostatit.com/sign)**.


## **Workspaces**

Metrics are placed inside **workspaces** and **collections**.

**Workspaces are created by teams or organisations**. In the following example, we will access the "[**xr**](https://www.gostatit.com/xr)" **workspace**. This workspace covers **exchange rates** metrics. It is a "public workspace" that every user on Statit can join.


## **Collections**

Collections are **groups of metrics inside a workspace**. Collections are defined by subject or source of data. Below, we will start working with the "**xr/weekly**" collection that includes all **weekly exchange rate metrics**.

Here is the link to the collection of [weekly exchange rate metrics](https://www.gostatit.com/xr/daily) that includes the metric we have looked at before. Click on the "About" tab for a description of the collection.

You can then browse the metrics in the collection. Metrics are presented like files in a folder. Navigate to the bottom of the folder to view any metric.

## **Metrics**

A **metric is a set of observations over time**.

**Every metric on Statit is defined by an 'id' or identifier**. Metric identifiers are similar to file identifiers on a computer such as [xr/weekly/eur/chf](https://www.gostatit.com/xr/weekly/eur/chf).

Let's have a look at [the weekly Euro-Swiss Franc exchange rates](https://www.gostatit.com/xr/weekly/eur/chf). Click on the link to reach the page of the metric.

The metric is described by its name, unit, sources, start date, end date, a description and finally its observations presented as a line chart.

### **Research**

You might want to zoom in on a specific time period or average observation values over time. You can do this from the metrics page.

To select a specific time period, use the sliders below the chart. You can can place your mouse over the line to see the value of the observation.

If you would like to see all values, press the grid on the top left hand side of the chart.

If you want to aggregate or transform observations (for instance, look at a moving average), press the wheel on the top right hand side of the chart.


### **Download**

You might need to work with this metric to compare it with other long-term trends, transform it or present it in a chart.

Click on the download icon on the right hand side and select the format you are interested in.


### **Favorites**

If you would like to save the metric to access it directly in your home page, click on the star on the top right of the screen.


## **Galleries**

Statit is a place for metrics and charts as well.

Charts are placed inside galeries and dashboards. Click on the ["regions" gallery](https://www.gostatit.com/s/xr/regions) to visualise regional exchange rate dashboards


## **Next steps**

You have now learnt about the basics of Statit: its organisation and how to navigate collections and galleries.
