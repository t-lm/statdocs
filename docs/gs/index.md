## Metrics

**On Statit, a metric measures something over time**.

For instance, the average daily temperature in Copenhagen, the monthly confidence index in the building sector in France, weekly export volumes of wheat in Romania, all are **metrics**.

**Sur Statit, we will use the term 'metrics'** because it is a term used in the public language. Some will use time series, statistical series, statistics or indices... For us, it is relatively similar.

On Statit, every **metric has a unique identifier**. An identifier is like an URL on the web. Every metric has a single link on Statit.

Let's jump in with the metrics we have described above:

- [Average daily temperature in the Copenhagen region](https://www.gostatit.com/clim/copernicus-r/daily/dk01/temp/real)
- [Monthly confidence index in the building sector in France](https://www.gostatit.com/bdfconj/consn/bat/total/ica/cvs_3m)
- [weekly export volumes of wheat in Romania](https://www.gostatit.com/eu-agri/cereals_trade_weekly/exports/ro/wheat-common/weekly)
