# A time series platform

Statit is a time series platform.

## Time series

**Time series represent a value over time**.

We find time series in many fields: economics, finance, industry, business, social & environmental sciences ...

For instance, the average daily temperature in Copenhagen, the monthly business confidence index in the building sector in France, weekly export volumes of wheat in Romania are all series.

**Sur Statit, we will use the term 'series'** instead of time series to make it simpler.

Statit hosts only tome series and every **serie has a unique identifier** on the platform.

Here are three series with their identifier:

- [Average daily temperature in the Copenhagen region](https://www.gostatit.com/clim/copernicus-r/daily/dk01/temp/real)
- [Monthly confidence index in the building sector in France](https://www.gostatit.com/bdfconj/consn/bat/total/ica/cvs_3m)
- [weekly export volumes of wheat in Romania](https://www.gostatit.com/eu-agri/cereals_trade_weekly/exports/ro/wheat-common/weekly)

**Click on the first link above** to access the serie.
