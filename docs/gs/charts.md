# Charts

Certain collections can contain charts.

Charts are a very useful way to present series in certain cases. They are organised inside dashboards.

Go back on the collection's landing page [xrate/daily](https://www.gostatit.com/xrate/daily) and click on the tab [CHARTS](https://www.gostatit.com/xrate/daily?tab=charts).

Three dashboards appear: americas, asia-pac et emea. Click on [asia-pac](https://www.gostatit.com/i/xrate/daily/asia-pac).

## The dashboard

The dashboard starts with a text followed by multiple charts.

 On this dashboard, you will see a summary of Asian currencies exchange rates evolutions against the Euro and most exchange rate charts.

This dashboard is updated daily by Statit.


## The chart

On the top right of each chart, you can click on the 'three dots' icon to download the chart (image or data). You will need to have an account for that ([here](https://www.gostatit.com/sign)).

At the bottom of the chart, you can click on "Sources" to visualise the series used to build the chart. You can click on each serie to see the original data.

Finally, you can add this chart to a "personal" dashboard. We will cover this in the next section.


## Next steps

Nice, you have accessed a dashboard and a chart in the  [xrate/daily](https://www.gostatit.com/xrate/daily) collection.

We will now explain what an [account](/gs/accounts.md) is.
