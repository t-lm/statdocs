# Collections

**Series are organised in collections**.

Like for books, **collections contain series that are similar** - series from a single source or covering the same subject.

Collections have also their own identifiers on Statit. Here are three examples:

- Daily international exchange rates: [xr/daily](https://www.gostatit.com/xr/daily)
- World historical and forecast cereal production from USDA: [psd/sd-grains](https://www.gostatit.com/psd/sd-grains)
- World bank commodity prices: [world-bank/pink](https://www.gostatit.com/world-bank/pink)

## Presentation

Let's click on the first link.

![Collection](/img/user-en_gs_org_1.png){: style="width:700px;margin:30px;padding:20px;border:1px solid #ddd;border-radius:5px"}

On the top left, 'xr' is the name of the account hosting the series.

This account is public and visible by everyone on the Internet. This is not the case of private accounts, only visible by their members.

A little below, you will find grey links [xr](https://www.gostatit.com/xr) / [daily](https://www.gostatit.com/xr/daily). These links allow you to navigate inside the collection.

Below, you will find the name of the collection (here "International daily exchange rates").


## Tabs

A collection contains three or four tabs:

- Description - the objective of the collection, its content, its organisation, its sources ...
- Series - the series (or the data itself)
- Charts - only in certain collections, charts based on the series
- Questions - a space where questions are asked and answered about the serie


## Series

In a collection, series are organised like files on a computer.

To find the serie you are interested in, you need to browse the directories of the collection by clicking on them (single click).

Click on the tab [Series](https://www.gostatit.com/xr/daily?tab=metrics).

![xr/daily](/img/user-en_gs_metrics_0.png){: style="width:700px;margin:30px;padding:20px;border:1px solid #ddd;border-radius:5px"}

You can see three directories:

- eur - exchange rates against Euro
- gbp - exchange rates against the Great British Pound (gbp)
- usd - exchange rates against United States Dollar (usd)

## Navigating down the collection

Click now on [eur](https://www.gostatit.com/xr/daily/eur). You will see a list of series preceded by a bar chart icon. You are nearly there.

![xr/daily/eur](/img/user-en_gs_metrics_1.png){: style="width:700px;margin:30px;padding:20px;border:1px solid #ddd;border-radius:5px"}

In this collection, series are named with 3 letters codes like "aud" or "brl". These codes use international for currencies: the [ISO 4217 norm](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217):

- "aud" is for Australian Dollar
- "brl" is for Brazilian Real ...

In the search input, type usd. Click then on [usd](https://www.gostatit.com/xr/daily/eur/usd) for US Dollar.
