# Collections

Series are organised in **collections**.

Collections contain **similar series**, coming from a same source or covering the same subject.

Collections have unique identifiers on Statit. We are going to explore the following three:

- Daily international exchange rates: [xrate/daily](https://www.gostatit.com/xrate/daily)
- Weekly rates: [xrate/weekly](https://www.gostatit.com/xrate/weekly)
- Monthly rates: [xrate/monthly](https://www.gostatit.com/xrate/monthly)

## Presentation

Click on the first link.

![Collection](/img/user-fr_gs_org_1.png){: style="width:700px;margin:30px;padding:20px;border:1px solid #ddd;border-radius:5px"}

On the top left, 'xrate' is the name of the account hosting the series.

This account is 'public' and visible by everyone on the Internet. This is not the case for private accounts, only visible by their members.

A little below, you will find grey links [xrate](https://www.gostatit.com/xrate) / [daily](https://www.gostatit.com/xrate/daily). These links allow you to navigate  inside the collection.

Below, you will find the name of the collection (here "International daily exchange rates").


## Tabs

A collection contains three or four tabs:

- Description - the objective of the collection, its content, its organisation, its sources ...
- Series - the **series**
- Charts - in certain collections, charts
- Questions - a space to ask questions about the series


## Series

Series are organised like files on a computer.

To find the serie you are interested in, you need to browse the directories by clicking on them (single click).

Click on the tab [Series](https://www.gostatit.com/xrate/daily?tab=metrics).

![xrate/daily](/img/user-fr_gs_metrics_0.png){: style="width:700px;margin:30px;padding:20px;border:1px solid #ddd;border-radius:5px"}

You can see three directories:

- eur - exchange rates against Euro
- gbp - exchange rates against the Great British Pound (gbp)
- usd - exchange rates against United States Dollar (usd)

## Navigating down the collection

Click now on [eur](https://www.gostatit.com/xrate/daily/eur). You will see a list of series preceded by a bar chart icon. You are nearly there.

![xrate/daily/eur](/img/user-fr_gs_metrics_1.png){: style="width:700px;margin:30px;padding:20px;border:1px solid #ddd;border-radius:5px"}

In this collection, series are named with 3 letters codes like "aud" or "brl". These codes use international for currencies: the [ISO 4217 norm](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217):

- "aud" is for Australian Dollar
- "brl" is for Brazilian Real ...

Click on [cny](https://www.gostatit.com/xrate/daily/eur/cny) for the Chinese Yuan.

![xrate/daily](/img/user-fr_gs_metrics_2.png){: style="width:700px;margin:30px;padding:20px;border:1px solid #ddd;border-radius:5px"}

This navigation logic, based on logical or explicit codes, will be used across all collections.

## Navigating up

To move back upward in the collection, you can click on the grey links on the top part of the page.

If you want to go back at the account level, click on [xrate](https://www.gostatit.com/xrate). If you want to go to the collection, click on [daily](https://www.gostatit.com/xrate/daily)

## Next steps

You have now visited a collection. You can visit some of the other [public collections](https://gostatit.com/public) on Statit.

Certain collections contain as well **charts**. We will talk about that in the [next section](/gs/charts).
