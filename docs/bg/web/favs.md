# Favourites and alerts

Statit allows you to save the series or collections you need to help you find them easily.


## Following a collection

To get started, we are going to follow a collection.

Head to the [Pink sheet](https://www.gostatit.com/world-bank/pink) collection. This is a public collection redistributing international commodity prices compiled by the World Bank.

On the top right of the page, you can see the ðŸ–¤ icon. Three options are possible:

- No alert - you will not receive an alert for this collection
- Alert on update - vous will receive an alert by email as soon as the collection is updated
- Alert once a week - you will receive an alert once a week on Thursday if the collection has been updated the previous week

Click on one of the options. You are now following the collection.


## Following a serie

Go now on [international orange prices](https://www.gostatit.com/world-bank/pink/prices/agri/orange/eur) by the World Bank.

On the top right, you will find the ðŸ–¤ icon. There are two more lines:

- The first one is "Alert on update (with threshold)". This allows you to set an additional alert criteria. You will be alerted only if the last value of the serie meets the criteria you set.

- The second is "Add to a personal dashboard". We will cover this in the next section.

Click on "Alert on update". We will change this a bit later.


## Access and change favorites

You have now created two favorites.

Go back to your home page to access them. Click on your username on the top right and choose "Home".

Click then on "Favorites" to see your favorites.

If you want to update the alert or remove it, click on the toggle on the right of each favorite.


## Following a dashboard

Finally, it is possible to follow a dashboard.

Go to the [dashboard with commodity price indices](https://www.gostatit.com/i/world-bank/pink/summary) from the World Bank.

On the top right, you can click on the ðŸ–¤ icon in the same way as with collections and series.
