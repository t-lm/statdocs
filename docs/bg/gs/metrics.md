# A metrics library

Statit is an online library designed to host metrics.

## What we call a metric

**We call metrics the measure of something over time**.

**Metrics are used in many fields**: finance, business, economics, social sciences, environmental sciences ...

The average daily temperature in Copenhagen, monthly confidence index in the building sector in France, weekly exports of wheat in Romania can all be represented by metrics.

**On Statit, we will often use term 'series'** instead of metrics. Both mean the same for us.

Statit hosts metrics and every **metric has a unique identifier** on the platform.

## Accessing your first metric

Here are three series with their identifiers:

- Average daily temperature in Copenhagen: [clim/copernicus-r/daily/dk01/temp/real](https://www.gostatit.com/clim/copernicus-r/daily/dk01/temp/real)
- Monthly confidence index in building sector in France: [bdfconj/consn/bat/total/ica/cvs_3m](https://www.gostatit.com/bdfconj/consn/bat/total/ica/cvs_3m)
- Weekly wheat export volumes in Romania: [eu-agri/cereals_trade_weekly/exports/ro/wheat-common/weekly](https://www.gostatit.com/eu-agri)

**Click on the first link above** to access the serie.
