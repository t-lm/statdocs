# **What is Statit?**

Statit is a **tool for teams to manage time series collaboratively**.

**Time series are great data structures** that support a range of **analytical use cases** such as economic research, strategic planning, environmental monitoring or performance reporting.

Time series are used in **education, academic research, government and in the business world**.


## What's the problem

In many cases, **analytical work is performed as part of a team**:

- **Developing collaborative time-serie intelligence** on a specific subject (physical market prices)
- **Planning business operations** using a set of common assumptions from sales, supply and finances
- **Monitoring activity across various organisations**

In the examples above, the team will at one point **need to share time series** inputs (case 1 and 2) or outputs (case 2 and 3).

But **how to share time series**? The best way is to **put time series in a shared central space** and let collaborators edit and access time series according to their needs.

Think Google docs or Dropbox for time series. But these do not work with time series. Neither does Excel. And setting-up a database is tricky and is just the beginning of a solution.


## The solution

Teams need an **out of the box collaborative registry for storing and accessing time series**.

**Here come Statit**

Statit provides a **managed collaborative registry** with four main advantages:

- **Securing time-serie assets** - All time series are stored in one place in the cloud with back-up and all revisions stored.
- **Enabling collaboration** - Teams collaborate around collections of series. Individual analysts can edit, review, access series according to the permissions provided by the collection administrator
- **Improving time-serie management efficiency** - By placing time series as shared ressources, teams collaborate much more efficiently, avoiding duplicate work and improving the quality of input and output
- **Accelerating analytical workflows** - With time series in a modern registry, analytical workflows can be  automated and scaled-up significantly.


## Public or private

Collections of time series on Statit are either public or private.

Public collections of time series are visible to all and anyone can consume time series. Some of these public collections might be looking for collaborators to develop and maintain the series. In this case, users can contact the administrator to take part.

Private collections of time series are only accessible to a select number of collaborators. They are not hidden from the public world.



## Getting started

To understand how Statit works, head over to public collections such as [historical long-term patents declaration in OECD countries since the 17th century](https://gostatit.com/cdi/patents) or [search for one](https://gostatit.com/search)

Explore the collection, explore time series and download time series. Save one of the serie for future reference in your subscriptions.

Then, install the Excel add-in to access data directly in Excel. See the full doc [here](gs_excel.md)
