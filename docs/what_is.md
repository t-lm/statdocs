# **What is Statit?**

**Statit helps teams share and access metrics simply**.


## **Metrics are difficult to access**

Whether it is monitoring a project, planning business activity or researching social and demographic trends, **metrics are the core element of planning and analysis**.

The problem is **is is often complex to access metrics** as metrics are **stored in various places** (applications, dashboards, reports, analyst team) or **complex to get** (through queries).

**There is no single place where everyone can simply access them** - in 2-3 clicks and across subjects and teams.


## **A space for metrics**

Statit is an online space where teams store and access metrics.

Statit has three main characteristics:

- **Accessible to all** - **Really!** - It is simple to navigate across metrics and access them - by anyone in the team, there is no barrier to metrics knowledge
- **Accessible in the tools you use today** - Whether it is a web browser, Microsoft Excel or a programming language (curl/ nodejs/ python), metrics can be accessed and edited - No need to adopt a new tool
- **Very simple to get started** - Start publishing and sharing metrics in minutes


## **Organised for teams**

Teams build **workspaces to share their metrics**.

Inside workspaces, metrics are organised inside collections. Each collection can be public - accessible by all members of the workspace - or private - only accessible by invited users.

Inside collections, members have specific roles. Some manage the collection and can invite users. Others can edit the metrics. Finally, others can only access the series.


## **Private or public spaces**

Some workspaces are "open" and can be joined by everyone on the Internet after sign-up. Open workspaces are useful to share open or collaborative datasets as metrics.
