# Basics

Statit is an online registry of time series.

It exists to help people build time-related knowledge. It could be economic, social, environmental, political, historical, industrial ... You name it.

## Why Statit

Statit is different from other time serie platforms in two ways:

- It is simple to access by everyone as time series are simple to discover, understand and use
- It is a platform built by a community: independent researchers and analysts


## Time series

Time series record values for a specific metric over time.

Temperature records, economic indices (such as the GDP or milk imports) or social indicators (unemployment) are all time series.

On Statit, each individual time serie has its own page and address. Here, we can have a look at [Monthly air temperature in Britanny in France](https://www.gostatit.com/climat-fr/cei-m/region/bretagne/temp) since 1980.

## Collections

Collections are groups of series on a specific subject.

Statit hosts collections built by independent researchers and analysts. Here is the link to a collection of [Long-term monthly air temperatures for France](https://www.gostatit.com/climat-fr/cei-m).

On the collection home page, you will find background on the time series published: rationale, sources, methodology, organisation, publisher ...

Series in the collection are organised as documents in a computer repository.


## Publishing

Statit hosts collections and time series built by analysts and researchers looking to share time-serie data.
