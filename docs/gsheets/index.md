# The Google Sheets add-on

This section will show you how to access metrics directly in Google Sheets.

To achieve this, you are going to install a Google Sheets add-on. We will explain you how below. 

**The Google Sheets add-on is currently in beta and will be released publicly soon. If you are would like to try it out, please get in touch [here](mailto:hi@gostatit.com)**


## Installing the add-in

Open Google Sheets. Click on the 'Extensions' tab on the navigation bar.

Select 'Add-ons' and then 'Get add-ons'. This will take you to the Google Workspace marketplace. 

In the 'Search' area, type in 'Statit'. This will take you to the add-on's main page. 

Select 'Install' and follow instructions. 

Once the add-on is installed, get started by clicking on the 'Statit' tab on the main menu.

## Beta version

In Beta, you do not need to sign-in to access Statit public series. 

In the future, you will need a free account to access public series. [Click here](https://www.gostatit.com/sign)
