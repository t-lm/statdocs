All examples are presented with 'curl'. You can run requests with any client. End-point All requests must be addressed to: https://api.gostatit.com/core . Core stands for the core API. ### request curl https://api.gostatit.com/core ### response { \"message\": \"Welcome on Statit core API\" } Authentication Your requests must be identified with your credentials : your username and API Key. Your username and API key can be found in the account section in the home page for your profile. The API uses basic Http authentication . On the command line, it looks like ### request curl -X POST \\ -u username:apikey \\ https://api.gostatit.com/core ### response { \"code\": \"ERROR_PARAM_REQUIRED\", ... } Actions Once you are authentified, you can call specific actions: getSerie, getCollection, putSerie ... You will do this by adding a json object to the query specifying the action called and the required inputs for the action. ### request curl -X POST \\ -u username:apikey \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{\"action\": \"getSerie\", \"input\": {\"id\": \"climat-fr/cei-m/region/bretagne/temp\"}}' \\ https://api.gostatit.com/core ### response { \"Item\": { \"unit\": \"Degree Celcius\", ... } } In the request above, we call the 'getSerie' action to get a single serie and pass a parameter called input with the 'id' of the serie we are requiring. If you would like to learn the basics about serie identifiers, please head over to Getting started on the web . Errors If your request can not be processed, the API will return an error code with an error message. ### request curl -X POST \\ -u username:apikey \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{\"action\": \"getSerie\" }' \\ https://api.gostatit.com/core ### response { \"code\": \"ERROR_PARAM_REQUIRED\", \"message\": \"Error. Your request is missing a required parameter. Please check the documentation\" } Accessing time series Getting a single time serie We have already explored this in the example above. Example ### request curl -X POST \\ -u username:apikey \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{\"action\": \"getSerie\", \"input\": {\"id\": \"clim/copernicus-r/daily/frh0/temp/real\"}}' \\ https://api.gostatit.com/core ### response { \"Item\": { \"unit\": \"Degree Celcius\", \"frequency\": \"M\", \"sources\": \"Copernicus. Climate and Environmental Series\", \"name\": \"Monthly real temperature\", \"updated\": \"2021-03-10T17:14:45.504Z\", \"observations\": \"[[\\\"1979-01-01\\\", \\\"1.6\\\"], [\\\"1979-02-01\\\", \\\"5.3\\\"], [\\\"1979-03-01\\\", \\\"6.7\\\"], [\\\"1979-04-01\\\", \\\"8.5\\\"], [\\\"1979-05-01\\\", \\\"11.0\\\"], [\\\"1979-06-01\\\", \\\"14.6\\\"] ...\" \"description\": \"Average monthly temperature (degree Celcius)\", \"id\": \"clim/copernicus-r/daily/frh0/temp/real\", \"tags\": [] } } The Item object is quite explicit. It contains both serie metadata and data. Note that observations is a stringified array. You can transform it into an array using JSON parsers. Listing time series The API let you request \"children\" series with a single parent. As an example, if you are looking to get all indicators for waste in \"Paris\", you will call dechets-fr/dma-dpt/paris/dechets-menagers-associes and the request will return all related time series. It is necessary to specify exactly the id of the parent. The size of the response is limited to 1MB. Example ### request curl -X POST \\ -u username:apikey \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{\"action\": \"listSeries\", \"input\": {\"id\": \"dechets/dma-dpt/paris/dechets-menagers-associes\"}}' \\ https://api.gostatit.com/core ### response { \"Items\": [ { \"unit\": \"Tons\", \"frequency\": \"Y\", \"sources\": \"Base Sinoe de l'Ademe\" , \"name\": \"Paris | D\u00e9chets m\u00e9nagers et associ\u00e9s | Valorisation \u00e9nerg\u00e9tique\", \"updated\": \"2021-02-24T07:05:32.120Z\", \"observations\": \"[[\\\"2009-01-01\\\", \\\"842125.33407\\\"], [\\\"2011-01-01\\\", \\\"833876.24514\\\"], [\\\"2013-01-01\\\", \\\"803965.81276\\\"], ...]\", \"description\": \"Paris.

Valorisation \u00e9nerg\u00e9tique\", \"id\": \"dechets-fr/dma-dpt/paris/dechets-menagers-associes/valo_energetique\" }, {...} ] } Pushing time series Before using the API to create a collection and push time series, we recommended you try doing it on the web first. Follow the documentation to understand the main concepts. Once you have done this, we will only recap the main steps to: Create a collection Add series to the collection Add authorisations to the collection Creating a collection You create a new collection by providing its 'id' and its 'name'. For this demo, we will create a temperature collection named 'temp'. Replace username and apikey by your credentials below. Example ### request curl -X POST \\ -u username:apikey \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{\"action\": \"putCollection\", \"input\": {\"id\": \"username/temp\", \"name\": \"My temperature collection\" }}' \\ https://api.gostatit.com/core ### response { \"input\": { \"id\": \"username/temp\" } } That's it. You have created your username/temp collection. Well done. Put a serie Now, let's add a serie inside. The required parameters for a serie are: id, name and frequency. Example ### request curl -X POST \\ -u username:apikey \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{\"action\": \"putSerie\", \"input\": {\"id\": \"username/temp/new-york\", \"name\": \"New York temperatures\", \"frequency\": \"D\", \"observations\": \"[[\\\"2021-03-07\\\", 10.0], [\\\"2021-03-08\\\", 11.4]]\" }}' \\ https://api.gostatit.com/core ### response { \"input\": { \"id\": \"username/temp/new-york\" } } That's it. You have added the username/temp/new-york serie to your collection. Congrats. Add an authorisation Now is the time to create an authorisation to make your serie available to other people. To keep it simple, we will make our serie public. To achieve this, we will use \"public\" as a username. Before we do this, try to access your series on https://gostatit.com/YOUR-USERNAME/temp/new-york. If you are not signed-in, you will not be able to see the serie. Then, create the authorisation. Example ### request curl -X POST \\ -u username:apikey \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{\"action\": \"putCollectionAuth\", \"input\": { \"id\": \"username/temp\", \"username\": \"public\", \"type\": \"viewer\" }}' \\ https://api.gostatit.com/core ### response { \"input\": { \"id\": \"username/temp\", \"username\": \"public\", \"type\": \"viewer\" } } Well done. Now check https://gostatit.com/YOUR-USERNAME/temp/new-york. Your collection and serie can be accessed by everyone. Removing the authorisation Time to clean-up. Let's remove the \"publics\" authorisation. Example ### request curl -X POST \\ -u username:apikey \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{\"action\": \"deleteCollectionAuth\", \"input\": { \"id\": \"username/temp\", \"username\": \"public\" }}' \\ https://api.gostatit.com/core ### response { \"input\": { \"id\": \"username/temp\", \"username\": \"public\", } } Removing the serie Now, let's remove the serie from the collection. ### request curl -X POST \\ -u username:apikey \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{\"action\": \"deleteSerie\", \"input\": { \"id\": \"username/temp/new-york\" }}' \\ https://api.gostatit.com/core ### response { \"input\": { \"id\": \"username/temp/new-york\", } } Removing the collection Now that we have emptied the collection, we can safely remove it. ### request curl -X POST \\ -u username:apikey \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{\"action\": \"deleteCollection\", \"input\": { \"id\": \"username/temp\" }}' \\ https://api.gostatit.com/core ### response { \"input\": { \"id\": \"username/temp\", } } That's it.

In this chapter, we will look at functions. Getting started To get started, type in any cell the formula =STAT.VALUE(\"xrate/monthly/eur/gbp\"). All Statit functions will start with STAT followed by a keyword. STAT.VALUE allows you to get the latest value of a serie. If the add-in installation worked, you will get the result after a few seconds. If this is the case, jump straight to the next section. If not, look at the troubleshooting section at the end of the page. Custom functions STAT.VALUE This function will get the last value for a serie.

On Statit, we will often use term 'series' instead of metrics. Both mean the same for us. Statit hosts metrics and every metric has a unique identifier on the platform. Accessing your first metric Here are three series with their identifiers: Average daily temperature in Copenhagen: clim/copernicus-r/daily/dk01/temp/real Monthly confidence index in building sector in France: bdfconj/consn/bat/total/ica/cvs_3m Weekly wheat export volumes in Romania: eu-agri/cereals_trade_weekly/exports/ro/wheat-common/weekly Click on the first link above to access the serie.
