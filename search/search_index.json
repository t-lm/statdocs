Download a serie To download a single serie, write in any cell the identifier of a public collection. Take for instance the serie 'eustat/apro_mk_colm/de/raw_milk_delivered' that represents the volumes of milk delivered by farms in Germany. Select the cell with the serie and click on \"Go\". That is it. After a few seconds, la s\u00e9rie est charg\u00e9e en dessous de l'identifiant Download a serie horizontally Another way to download the serie above is to write in a cell 'get:eustat/apro_mk_colm/de/raw_milk_delivered' (do not put ''). 'get' is used to download a serie vertically. 'geth' is used to get a serie horizontally. In a different place in the worksheet, write 'geth:eustat/apro_mk_colm/de/raw_milk_delivered'. Select the cell. Click go. The serie appears now horizontally Download multiple series It is possible to download multiple series with a single call. You only have to separate them with commas. The formula 'get:xrate/monthly/eur/cad,xrate/monthly/eur/aud,xrate/monthly/eur/cny' lets you download the three exchange rate series (CAD, AUD, CNY) against Euro. Download series from a collection It is possible to download multiple series from the same collection (or from the same directory, remember, a collection is organised like a directory of files). For instance, to get all monthly metrics against Euro, you can use the following formula 'get:xrate/monthly/eur/*'. '*' means all series with an identifier starting with 'xrate/monthly/eur/'.

Sur Statit, we will use the term 'series' instead of time series to make it simpler. Statit hosts only tome series and every serie has a unique identifier on the platform. Here are three series with their identifier: Average daily temperature in the Copenhagen region Monthly confidence index in the building sector in France weekly export volumes of wheat in Romania Click on the first link above to access the serie. The description On the page of the serie, you can see: the name of the serie : Average daily temperature for Hovedstaden region (Denmark) its description - Average daily temperature for Hovedstaden region (Danemark) ...
