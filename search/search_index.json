In this chapter, we will look at functions. Getting started To get started, type in any cell the formula =STATIT_OBS(\"xr/monthly/eur/gbp\"). All Statit functions will start with STATIT followed by a keyword. STATIT_OBS allows you to get the latest value of a serie. If the add-in installation worked, you will get the result after a few seconds. Now copy paste the formula =STATIT_SERIE(\"xr/monthly/eur/gbp\"). This should return an array with two columns. The first one represents the date of the observation, the second one represents the value of the observation. The date is represented as a number as this is the way it is coded in Excel. To make sense, select the date column and format it as a Date. If all works fine, jump straight to the next section. Note that all examples use international formating with function arguments separated with a \",\". In certain countries, you might have to replace the commas with a \";\". If you are facing problems, look at the troubleshooting section at the end of the page. Custom functions STATIT_OBS This function will display the value of the last observation for a serie Parameter: id - for example, \"xr/monthly/eur/gbp\" Parameter: periods (optional) - the number of periods starting from the most recent one (by default, the last period or 1) Returns: number - the latest value of the serie in a single cell, for example 1.08 Examples: =STATIT_OBS(\"xr/monthly/eur/gbp\") =STATIT_OBS(\"xr/monthly/eur/gbp\", 3) STATIT_OBS_CHANGE This function will get the change between the last value of the serie and another one Parameter: id - for example, \"xr/monthly/eur/gbp\" Parameter: periods (optional) - the number of periods between the last value and the one considered (by default, 1) Returns: number - the latest value of the serie in a single cell, for example 1.08 Examples: =STATIT_OBS_CHANGE(\"xr/monthly/eur/gbp\") =STATIT_OBS_CHANGE(\"xr/monthly/eur/gbp\", 5) STATIT_OBS_CHANGE_PERCENT This function will get the change in percentage between the last value of the serie and another one Parameter: id - for example, \"xr/monthly/eur/gbp\" Parameter: periods (optional) - the number of periods between the last value and the one considered (by default, 2) Returns: number - the latest value of the serie in a single cell, for example 1.08 Examples: =STATIT_OBS_CHANGE_PERCENT(\"xr/monthly/eur/gbp\") =STATIT_OBS_CHANGE_PERCENT(\"xr/monthly/eur/gbp\", 5) STATIT_OBS_DATE This function will display the date of the last observation Parameter: id - for example, \"xr/monthly/eur/gbp\" Parameter: periods (optional) - the number of periods starting from the most recent one (by default, the last period or 1) Returns: number - the latest value of the serie in a single cell, for example 1.08 Example: =STATIT_OBS_DATE(\"xr/monthly/eur/gbp\") STATIT_SERIE This function will get all observations for a serie with their dates and values. This is useful when we need the full historic perspective on the serie Parameter: id - for example, \"world-bank/pink/prices/agri/orange/usd\" Parameter: observations (optional) - the number of observations to return Parameter: direction (optional) - the direction of the observation, 1 for the chronological order, -1 for the opposite Returns: an array with a a list of values and dates Examples: =STATIT_SERIE(\"world-bank/pink/prices/agri/orange/usd\") =STATIT_SERIE(\"world-bank/pink/prices/agri/orange/usd\",4) =STATIT_SERIE(\"world-bank/pink/prices/agri/orange/usd\",6,-1) STATIT_SERIE_H This is the same function as the one above but this will return observations horizontally. STATIT_SERIE_CHANGE Gets all observations for a serie averaged over a period of time Parameter: id - for example, \"world-bank/pink/prices/agri/orange/usd\" Parameter: periods (optional) - the number of periods used to average the values Parameter: observations (optional) - the number of observations to return Parameter: direction (optional) - the direction of the observation, 1 for the chronological order, -1 for the opposite Returns: an array with a a list of values and dates Examples: =STATIT_SERIE_CHANGE(\"world-bank/pink/prices/agri/orange/usd\") =STATIT_SERIE_CHANGE(\"world-bank/pink/prices/agri/orange/usd\",6) =STATIT_SERIE_CHANGE(\"world-bank/pink/prices/agri/orange/usd\",6,4) =STATIT_SERIE_CHANGE(\"world-bank/pink/prices/agri/orange/usd\",6,4,-1) Troubleshooting There are different possible issues The function is not recognised In this case, when you type =STATIT in any cell, Excel does not recognise the function. When you have finished typing, Excel return something like #NAME?. This means that the custom function is not yet recognised by Excel. The first option is check if the function has been loaded. Try clearing the add-in cache on the top right hand side of the add-in on the right and reloading the add-in. If it still does not work, try restarting Excel and try again. The second option is to clear Excel cache. This is not harmful operation. Please check online Microsoft documentation for \"clearing excel cache\".

In this page, we will look at the taskpane. Downloading a serie To download a single serie, write in any cell the identifier of a public collection.

That is it. After a few seconds, the serie is available in the sheet Downloading a serie horizontally Another way to download the serie above is to write in a cell 'get:eustat/apro_mk_colm/de/raw_milk_delivered' (do not put ''). 'get' is used to download a serie vertically. 'geth' is used to get a serie horizontally. In a different place in the worksheet, write 'geth:eustat/apro_mk_colm/de/raw_milk_delivered'. Select the cell. Click go. The serie appears now horizontally Downloading multiple series It is possible to download multiple series with a single call. You only have to separate them with commas. The formula 'get:xr/monthly/eur/cad,xr/monthly/eur/aud,xr/monthly/eur/usd' lets you download the three exchange rate series (CAD, AUD, USD) against Euro. Downloading all series from a collection It is possible to download multiple series from the same collection (or from the same directory, remember, a collection is organised like a directory of files). For instance, to get all monthly metrics against Euro, you can use the following formula 'get:xr/monthly/eur/*'. '*' means all series with an identifier starting with 'xr/monthly/eur/'.

What we call a metric We call metrics the measure of something over time . Metrics are used in many fields : finance, business, economics, social sciences, environmental sciences ... The average daily temperature in Copenhagen, monthly confidence index in the building sector in France, weekly exports of wheat in Romania can all be represented by metrics. On Statit, we will often use term 'series' instead of metrics. Both mean the same for us. Statit hosts metrics and every metric has a unique identifier on the platform. Accessing your first metric Here are three series with their identifiers: Average daily temperature in Copenhagen: clim/copernicus-r/daily/dk01/temp/real Monthly confidence index in building sector in France: bdfconj/consn/bat/total/ica/cvs_3m Weekly wheat export volumes in Romania: eu-agri/cereals_trade_weekly/exports/ro/wheat-common/weekly Click on the first link above to access the serie. The description On the page, you see: the name of the serie : Average daily temperature for Hovedstaden region (Denmark) its description : Average daily temperature for Hovedstaden region (Denmark) ... And below: the frequency of observations : Daily the unit : Degree Celsius the sources : Copernicus Service the starting and end date of the serie and the date of the last update Below, you can view the serie as a line chart. If you move your mouse over the chart, you will be able to see the values. Finally, at the bottom of the chart, the grey area allows you to select a specific time period. Try for instance to select the 2021 year by pulling the \"left handle\" towards the right. Reading values You can click on the small icons above the chart on the left to change the view to a bar chart or values. Click on the grid to see the values. You can then sort the lines by date or by value by clicking on the arrows above the columns. Downloading the serie On the top right of the chart, click on the icon with an downward arrow. You can download the chart as an image or the values in an Excel ou CSV file (with vertical or horizontal values). Create an account here to download the serie. It is free and takes 2 minutes. Perform preliminary analysis You can perform preliminary analysis on the serie to better put in perspective the values. Click on the icon on the right of the download menu.You can aggregate values on different time periods or make simple transformations (for instance, view variations between values).
