Downloading a serie To download a single serie, write in any cell the identifier of a public collection. Take for instance the serie 'eustat/apro_mk_colm/de/raw_milk_delivered' that represents the volumes of milk delivered by farms in Germany. Select the cell with the serie and click on \"Go\". That is it. After a few seconds, the serie is available in the sheet Downloading a serie horizontally Another way to download the serie above is to write in a cell 'get:eustat/apro_mk_colm/de/raw_milk_delivered' (do not put ''). 'get' is used to download a serie vertically. 'geth' is used to get a serie horizontally. In a different place in the worksheet, write 'geth:eustat/apro_mk_colm/de/raw_milk_delivered'. Select the cell. Click go. The serie appears now horizontally Downloading multiple series It is possible to download multiple series with a single call. You only have to separate them with commas. The formula 'get:xrate/monthly/eur/cad,xrate/monthly/eur/aud,xrate/monthly/eur/usd' lets you download the three exchange rate series (CAD, AUD, USD) against Euro. Downloading all series from a collection It is possible to download multiple series from the same collection (or from the same directory, remember, a collection is organised like a directory of files). For instance, to get all monthly metrics against Euro, you can use the following formula 'get:xrate/monthly/eur/*'. '*' means all series with an identifier starting with 'xrate/monthly/eur/'.

What we call a metric We call metrics the measure of something over time . Metrics are used in many fields : finance, business, economics, social sciences, environmental sciences ... The average daily temperature in Copenhagen, monthly confidence index in the building sector in France, weekly exports of wheat in Romania can all be represented by metrics. On Statit, we will often use term 'series' instead of metrics. Both mean the same for us. Statit hosts metrics and every metric has a unique identifier on the platform. Accessing your first metric Here are three series with their identifiers: Average daily temperature in Copenhagen: clim/copernicus-r/daily/dk01/temp/real Monthly confidence index in building sector in France: bdfconj/consn/bat/total/ica/cvs_3m Weekly wheat export volumes in Romania: eu-agri/cereals_trade_weekly/exports/ro/wheat-common/weekly Click on the first link above to access the serie.

Creating the dashboard To start, we are going to create a personal dashboard. Our goal is to create a dashboard to monitor various energy prices internationally. Go on the home page of your account by clicking on \"Home\" in the menu on the top right of the page. Click on the \"Dashboard\" tab, then on the button \"Create a dashboard\" just under. You are reaching the following screen. You are now going to give an identifier and a name to your dashboard. Here we have used \"energy-prices\" as an identifier and \"International energy prices\" as a name. You can use the identifiers and names you like. Click on \"Save\" Adding charts First chart Let's visit first a chart that provides average daily electricity prices across Europe. This chart is part of an account with data from the association of electricity network operators in Europe. It is here . On the top right of the line chart with the series, click on the three dots icon. Select \"Add to a personal dashboard\". You are now being asked in which dashboard to add the chart. Select the one you have just created. Click on \"Save\" Second chart Let's add now a second chart with oil \"futures\". Go to this EIA dashboard . Pick the chart with the series. Repeat the same steps to add this chart to your dashboard. Adding series We have added two charts to our dashboard. We are now going to add a serie. You can for instance visit French gas prices published by the French network operator. On the top right, click on the heart and add to a personal dashboard. Select the dashboard, the 'Line chart' format and save. Changing charts After adding the serie, you are redirected to your dashboard with the three charts above. We are going to change the last serie we have added to make it start in 2022. Click on the top right of the chart on \"Update chart\". In the field \"Name\", write 'Natural Gas Prices in EUR/ MWh'. Then, on the section below with series, click on the toggle on the right and choose 'Update'. In the \"Start\" cell, write \"2022-01-01\" to start on the 1st of January 2022. We use this way of writing dates with year, month and days separated with dashes on Statit. In the \"Color\" section, pick a different color. Click on 'Save'. The dashboard We have done this to create a dashboard that contains the key metrics we are interested in. You will find this dashboard in your \"Home\" on the \"Dashboard\" tab. The dashboard will always be up to date with the latest values. You can now create dashboards with series from public collections and private accounts of which you are a member. If you want to remove the dashboard, start by removing each chart (top right of the chart) and then remove the dashboard. Next steps You have now learnt to build your own dashboards and charts.
