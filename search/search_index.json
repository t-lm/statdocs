The benefit is to accelerate discovery of series and use of multiple time series directly in Excel. To get started, follow installation instructions. Installation In an Excel workbook, go to \"Insert\" and look for \"Add-In\", then \"Download Add-in\". On the Add-in store, search for add-ins and look for statit. Press add. The add-in will show as an icon on the right in the main menu. That's it. Signin-in Once the add-in opens, click on the \"credentials\" tab Enter your username Enter your API key (you will find this in your web account in the home tab) Simple queries There are two types of queries in the add-in: - simple queries where you get the data directly in the sheet where you are working - batch queries where you specific the query in advance and run all the queries together Get a time serie This is the simplest query. Insert the id of a serie in any cell (for instance, cvfr/hosp-dpt/paris/hosp_in) With the cell selected, press \"GET\" The serie is returned starting in the cell below. Next to the id, you will find the status of the query, the date of the query, the size of the query (number of series returned). If there is an error, look at these possible solutions: Fill-in your username and password Check the 'id' is correct by finding it on the web application Make sure you are online Get multiple time series Insert the ids of the series you are looking for separated with a \",\" With the cell selected, press \"GET\" List all time series in a collection or a specific path in the collection Insert the id of the collection or the path to the serie in any cell ending with a \"*\" (cvfr/hosp-dpt/paris*) With the cell selected, press \"GET\" Notes: You can not perform multiple list queries separated with a \",\" Batch queries To perform batch queries, insert a \"batch\" sheet inside your workbook Starting on the 2nd line, add a line for every query (limited to 25): In the 1st cell, insert the query string (similar to simple queries) In the 2nd cell, insert the name of the target worksheet (where the response will be sent) In the 3rd cell, insert the name of the target cell (where response will be displayed) Press \"BATCH\" For every query (on every line), you will get the following codes: Status: OK or error (first cell on the right after target cell) Date: full ISO date (second cell) Size: number of series returned (third cell)","title":"Accessing serie (Excel)"},{"location":"access-excel/#accessing-series-in-microsoft-excel","text":"This page explains how to use time series directly in Microsoft Excel.

Time series Let's have a look at Monthly air temperature in Britanny in France since 1980. As you click on the link, you will reach a time serie. It is described by its name, description, unit and finally the serie presented as a chart. Understanding trends Some of the series are hard to understand as such. This is the case for volatile measures that are highly seasonal like temperature. To that end, on the serie page, you can click on the small wheel on the right hand side. A menu will appear with different ways to look at the serie: changing the frequency (from monthly to yearly serie) or to average the data over last periods. In the example above, in Aggregation, select annual (and average). In Transformation, select last 4 periods. The underlying trend of roughly 1.5 degrees Celsius increase in the last 30 years will be easier to spot then. Downloading the serie You might now need to work with this data to compare it with other long-term trends, transform it or present it in a chart. Click on the down arrow on the right hand side and select the format you are interested in. The difference between the European and the UK & US formats lie in the decimal separator (, for Europe and . for UK & US) Following the serie If you are interested in the serie and would like to save it for future reference, click on the star on the top right of the screen. You will need to be signed-in to access that feature. The series you follow will be accessible from your home page in the favorites tab. On this tab, you will be able to set a notification when to get an email when the serie is updated or on a weekly or monthly basis. Collections Time series belong to collections which are groups of series that are related to each other. You can navigate in the collection by clicking on the grey links just under the serie name. Here is the link to the collection of long-term monthly air temperatures that includes the serie we have looked at before. The collection page will provide the background on the time series published: rationale, sources, methodology, organisation ...

Collections and series Time series are published inside collections. Collections are groups of time series on a specific subject. Inside a collection, your time series will relate to a similar subject, cover a similar time range and be structured in the same way. You can see how collections look like here: French departmental air pollution indicators Long-term energy consumption in France Inside collections, you will place time series. Time series have unique identifiers similar to files on a computer. They follow the following format: [username] / [collection key] / [serie path]: username is your username with no capital letters collection key is a specific identifier for the collection (only alpha-numerical characters and point, underscore and dash characters) serie path is a specific identifier for the serie in the collection (same characters as collection key and slash ) Slashes can be added to the serie path. This is a way to structure how you navigate inside your collection. The slashes play the role of subfolders. For instance, the serie bdf-conj/commn/categorie/chaussure/indice-valeur/brut has the following structure: username: bdj-conj collection key: commn serie path: categorie/chaussure/indice-valeur/brut Collections are either public or private. Public collections will be accessible by anyone on the web. Private collections (and the series inside) will only be visible to the authorised collaborators.
