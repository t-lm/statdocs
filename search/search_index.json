The Statit Excel \"add-in\" will allow you to perform basic operations. If you want to go further, you can develop your own add-ins and use the Statit API . Installation In an Excel workbook, go to the \"Insertion\" tab inside the workbook. Look for \"Add-Ins\" or \"Download Add-ins\". On Microsoft Add-in store, search for 'statit'. Press add to install the Statit add-in. The add-in will show as an icon on the right in the main menu. Good job. Signin-in Once the add-in opens, click on the \"Sign in\" tab Enter your username Enter your API key (you will find this in your web account in the home tab) Get series There are two ways to run queries in the add-in: - Get - You specify the query and get the response directly in the sheet where you are working - Batch get - You specify multiple queries in advance, run the queries all together and get the response where it suits you Get a time serie This is the simplest query. Insert the id of a serie in any cell (for instance, cvfr/hosp-dpt/paris/hosp_in) With the cell selected, press \"GET\" The serie is returned starting in the cell below. Next to the id, you will find the status of the query, the date of the query, the size of the query (number of series returned). If there is an error, look at these possible solutions: Fill-in your username and password Check the 'id' is correct by finding it on the web application Make sure you are online Get multiple time series Insert the ids of the series you are looking for separated with a \",\" With the cell selected, press \"GET\" List all time series in a collection or a specific path in the collection Insert the id of the collection or the path to the serie in any cell ending with a \"*\" (cvfr/hosp-dpt/paris*) With the cell selected, press \"GET\" Notes: You can not perform multiple list queries separated with a \",\" Batch Get queries To perform batch queries, insert a \"batch\" sheet inside your workbook Starting on the 2nd line, add a line for every query (limited to 25): In the 1st cell, insert the query string (similar to simple queries) In the 2nd cell, insert the name of the target worksheet (where the response will be sent) In the 3rd cell, insert the name of the target cell (where response will be displayed) Press \"BATCH\" For every query (on every line), you will get the following codes: Status: OK or error (first cell on the right after target cell) Date: full ISO date (second cell) Size: number of series returned (third cell) Put series You can put series directly in the collections you have created in Statit. You can not create a collection from inside Excel. Head over to the web instructions to learn how to create a collection. A single serie Starting anywhere in the sheet, present the serie you want to put in the following format: On line 1, in cell 1, write 'put' (without '') On line 2, in cell 1, write 'id' and in cell 2 the value of the 'id' On line 3, in cell 1, write 'name' and in cell 2 the value of the 'name' On line 4, in cell 1, write 'frequency' and in cell 2 the value of the 'frequency' On line 5, in cell 1, write 'unit' and in in cell 2 the value of the 'unit' On line 8, in cell 1, write the date (in YYYY-MM-DD) format (set the format of the cell as Text) and in cell 2, the value of the observation Continue with observations on the following lines and press 'Put'. Multiple series You can put multiple series as long as they share the same dates. Just, put the series in columns next to each other and select all series before pressing 'Put'.

Accessing time series A time serie Let's have a look at the number of patents declared in the US since the end of the 19th century. As you click on the link, you will reach the page of a time serie. It is described by its name, description, unit and finally its observations presented as a chart. Understanding the serie Looking at the chart is a first step. We might be interested in the value at a specific point in time. Use the cursor below the graph to zoom on the period that is relevant. Move your mouse on the chart to look at a specific value. If you are interested in exploring the numbers, click on the \"grid\" on the top left hand corner of the chart. This will allow you to browse the serie as a table of numbers. Looking at trends Some of the series are hard to understand as such. This is the case of volatile measures that are highly seasonal like temperature. See monthly air temperature records in Brittany since 1980 We need a way to understand the trends. Averaging the observations of the last 12 months would allow to remove the seasonal movement of temperatures. On the serie page above, find the small wheel on the top right hand side of the chart. A menu will appear with different ways to look at the serie such as changing the period of reporting. In the example above, in Aggregation, select annual (and average). In Transformation, select last 4 periods. The underlying trend of roughly 1.5 degrees Celsius increase in the last 30 years will be easier to spot then. Downloading the serie You might now need to work with this data to compare it with other long-term trends, transform it or present it in a chart. Click on the down arrow on the right hand side and select the format you are interested in. European and the UK & US formats differ in the decimal separator in numbers (',' for Europe and '.' for UK & US). Following the serie If you are interested in the serie and would like to save it for future reference, click on the star on the top right of the screen. You will need to be signed-in to access that feature. The series you follow will be accessible from your home page in the favorites tab. On this tab, you will be able to set a notification when to get an alert when the serie is updated. Collections Time series belong to collections which are groups of related series. You can navigate in the collection by clicking on the grey links just under the serie name. Here is the link to the collection of long-term monthly air temperatures that includes the serie we have looked at before. The collection page will provide the background on the time series included: rationale, sources, methodology, structure, contact details ... Next steps You have now learnt the basics of Statit: how to find a serie, how to use it and follow it, how to find a collection and navigate inside it. If you would like to use time series directly in Excel, please go to the Excel section If you would like to start your own collections, continue reading. Building a collection Access Building collections on Statit is for the moment limited to \"beta\" users. You are welcome to get started, please get in touch at hi@gostatit.com . The following guide is for users with access to that feature. Collections and series Time series are placed inside collections. Collections represent series on a similar subject, time range, structure or audience. You can visit the following public collections to get a sense of what they are: French departmental air pollution indicators Monthly indices of retail activity in France Time series have unique identifiers similar to file names on a computer. Time serie identifiers follow the format: [username] / [key of the collection] / [key of the serie]: username: the username of the collection administrator key of the collection: the specific identifier for the collection (only alpha-numerical characters and point, underscore and dash characters) key of the serie: specific identifier for the serie in the collection (same characters as collection key and slash ) Slashes can be added to the key of the serie. Slashes are a way to structure the navigation inside your collection. The slashes play the role of subfolders when browsing the collection. For instance, the serie bdf-conj/commn/categorie/chaussure/indice-valeur/brut has the following structure: username: bdj-conj (stands for \"banque de france - conjoncture\" - an account dedicated to tracking) key of the collection: commn (stands for commerce national) key of the serie: categorie/chaussure/indice-valeur/brut Collections are either public or private. Public collections will be visible by anyone on the web and time series accessible by anyone on the web. Private collections (and the time series inside) will only be visible and accessible by the authorised collaborators. Creating a collection Go to the home page and click on the \"Collections\" tab. On the right hand side, click on \"Add collection\" Fill the required fields for the collection: key and name Press save Adding a serie Now that your collection is created, you can add your first serie: Click on the collection On the top right hand side, click on \"Add serie\" Fill the required field for the time serie Press save You have two options for adding observations: Load a CSV file with the serie observations Write (or paste) values manually We currently only accept observations with the following format: Dates following the ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DD (for example: 2021-01-02) Values with decimal separator as a point Each observation is on one line (date, observation) Date and observations must be split by either \",\" or \";\" or a tab Adding authorisations By default, your collection and the time series it includes are private. The owner is the only one who can see them. To collaborate with others, you need to add access rights to the collection. There are four different types of rights you can provide to other users: - Observer - This allows the user to view the collection and its time series - Member - This allows the user to view the collection, its time series and participate with comments - Editor - This allows the user to view and edit the collection - Administrator - This allows the user to view, edit the collection and manage access rights You add users with their email or their Statit username.

What's the problem In many cases, analytical work is performed as part of a team : Developing collaborative time-serie intelligence on a specific subject (physical market prices) Planning business operations using a set of common assumptions from sales, supply and finances Monitoring activity across various organisations In the examples above, the team will at one point need to share time series inputs (case 1 and 2) or outputs (case 2 and 3). But how to share time series ? The best way is to put time series in a shared central space and let collaborators edit and access time series according to their needs. Think Google docs or Dropbox for time series. But these do not work with time series. Neither does Excel. And setting-up a database is tricky and is just the beginning of a solution. The solution Teams need an out of the box collaborative registry for storing and accessing time series . Here come Statit Statit provides a managed collaborative registry with four main advantages: Securing time-serie assets - All time series are stored in one place in the cloud with back-up and all revisions stored. Enabling collaboration - Teams collaborate around collections of series. Individual analysts can edit, review, access series according to the permissions provided by the collection administrator Improving time-serie management efficiency - By placing time series as shared ressources, teams collaborate much more efficiently, avoiding duplicate work and improving the quality of input and output Accelerating analytical workflows - With time series in a modern registry, analytical workflows can be automated and scaled-up significantly. Public or private Collections of time series on Statit are either public or private. Public collections of time series are visible to all and anyone can consume time series. Some of these public collections might be looking for collaborators to develop and maintain the series. In this case, users can contact the administrator to take part. Private collections of time series are only accessible to a select number of collaborators. They are not hidden from the public world. Getting started To understand how Statit works, head over to public collections such as historical long-term patents declaration in OECD countries since the 17th century or search for one Explore the collection, explore time series and download time series. Save one of the serie for future reference in your subscriptions. Then, install the Excel add-in to access data directly in Excel.
